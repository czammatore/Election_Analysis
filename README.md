# A Review and Analysis of Election Results – Jefferson, Denver and Arapahoe counties

We were asked by election officials to create code that could be run to add up and break out election results from a .csv file they provided us. Data they requested included the total number of votes cast, the number and percentage of votes cast by county, the county with the largest turnout, the count and percentage of the vote that each candidate received and the winning candidate.

## Results
*	There were 369,711 votes cast in this election.
*	The data was gathered from 3 counties:
* Jefferson County cast 38,855 votes, which was 10.5% of total votes cast
* Denver County cast 306,055 votes, which was 82.8% of total votes cast
*	Arapahoe County cast 24,801 votes, which was 6.7% of total votes cast.
*	Denver County had the largest number of votes cast.

The data gathered looked at three specific candidates:
*	Charles Casper Stockham received 85,213 votes, which was 23% of total votes cast
*	Diana De Gette received 272,892 votes, which was 73.8% of total votes cast
*	Raymon Anthony Doane received 11,606 votes, which was 3.1% of total votes cast.
*	Based on the above data, we can see that Diana De Gette was the clear winner of the election.

## Future Use of this Script

This script can be used for anything from a local school board election to a state senate election. The variables would need to be modified to reflect the respective variables – for example county info might need to be switched for town or political party, and the wording in the results printout would need to reflect the update as well. When extracting data, they would also need to pay mind to the need to change the name (from county_name to town_name) for example and the row in which this information is located if the .csv file being used has greater or fewer columns, or if the data is in a different order.
